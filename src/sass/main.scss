/*
 * Sass main file. Only imports sass partials.
 *
 * Due to the size of the application, I've decided to implement a really simple
 * architecture here:
 *
 * - variables: self-explanatory.
 * - base: Html and body tag styles, global typography...
 * - ui/*: UI elements which are NOT unique to a React component (buttons, etc.)
 * - components/*: React components.
 *
 * In a more complex SASS architecture, many sources recommend a components folder
 * for all your reusable bits, including buttons. But because there's a clear difference
 * between a IMPLICIT reusable HTML element (generic buttons, generic inputs...) and an
 * EXPLICIT React component, I've decided to do it this way.
 *
 * I've also decided NOT to use a 'layout' folder for layout styling. Again, React is
 * organized in a per component basis. Better stick to that mindset.
